## How are graceful degradation and service workers related?

Graceful degradation is a design strategy aimed at ensuring a system continues to function at a reduced level even when certain components fail or are unsupported. Service workers are integral to achieving graceful degradation in web applications. They enable the caching of resources and the interception of network requests, which allows for offline access and enhances performance by delivering cached content. In scenarios where the network is down or slow, service workers help maintain access to essential features and content which ensures that the user experience remains functional rather than having the application fail entirely. Hence, service workers gracefully degrade the user experience instead of completely breaking the application.
